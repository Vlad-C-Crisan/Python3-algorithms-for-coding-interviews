# Python3-algorithms-for-coding-interviews

The repository contains the Python3 implementation of the most commonly used algorithms in coding interviews.

The algorithms are grouped into two main categories: Graph Algorithms and Sorting and order statistics.

Each file contains a separate algorithm, as indicated by the file's name. Each file contains a detailed description of the implementation, as well as test cases.

All the algorithms represent own implementations and I take full responsibility for any mistakes. 
The main reference I used is the book "Introduction to Algorithms", third edition by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein. I also tried to reference any additional resources I used in the description of each algorithm.
